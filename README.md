# Product Recommendation Analysis Project

### Introduction

A product recommendation is basically a filtering system that seeks to predict and show the items that a user would like to purchase. With the purpose of growing business on the internet and with a significant rise in the number of users, it is becoming important for companies to search, map and provide them with the relevant chunk of information according to their preferences and tastes. 

Hence to cater this problem I architected a SQL-based Superstore Data Warehouse and analysed trends of 10K customer records to identify profitable market segments. (Note: SQL codes are mentioned in the above files.) 


### Tools Used

* Excel for Data Cleaning
* Tableau for creating dashboard
* SQL for analysis
* Python for Model Building


### Analytics

I designed Quarterly Sales Forecasting Dashboard to get insights on State Wise Distribution of Sales & Profit Time Series using Tableau.

Here is the glimpse of dashboard.

Top 3 observations made are as mentioned below:

1. The Quarterly Sales Forecasting is expected to grow in 2018 Q4.
2. "Consumer" Category Segment are the most Profitable Customers for our business.
3. "California" is biggest and profitable market in consumer segment whereas "North Darkota" is the least.


### Model Building

â€¢	Built Popularity and Collaborative Recommendation Systems using Python NLP Model to suggest the right items based on user interests.
