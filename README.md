# Product Recommendation Analysis Project

### Introduction

A product recommendation is basically a filtering system that seeks to predict and show the items that a user would like to purchase. With the purpose of growing business on the internet and with a significant rise in the number of users, it is becoming important for companies to search, map and provide them with the relevant chunk of information according to their preferences and tastes. 

Hence to cater this problem I architected a SQL-based Superstore Data Warehouse and analysed trends of 10K customer records to identify profitable market segments. (Note: SQL codes are mentioned in the above files.) 

### Work Process

1. Data Cleaning: Utilized Excel to clean and preprocess the collected data, ensuring accuracy and consistency.
2. Data Warehouse Architecture: Designed and implemented a SQL-based Superstore Data Warehouse to store and organize the cleaned data effectively.
3. Trend Analysis: Conducted a thorough analysis of 10K customer records using SQL queries to identify trends and patterns in sales and customer behavior.
4. Dashboard Creation: Utilized Tableau to create a Quarterly Sales Forecasting Dashboard, visualizing state-wise distribution of sales and profit time series data. Through which mentioned below insights are extracted insights from the dashboard.
5. Model Building: Employed Python NLP (Natural Language Processing) models to develop Popularity and Collaborative Recommendation Systems, enabling personalized item suggestions based on user interests.

### Tools Used

* Excel for Data Cleaning
* Tableau for creating dashboard
* SQL for analysis
* Python for Model Building


### Analytics

I designed Quarterly Sales Forecasting Dashboard to get insights on State Wise Distribution of Sales & Profit Time Series using Tableau.

Here is the glimpse of dashboard.

Top 3 observations made are as mentioned below:

1. **Anticipated Growth:** The Quarterly Sales Forecasting indicates an expected increase in sales for the fourth quarter of 2018.

2. **Profitable Customer Segment:** The "Consumer" category demonstrates the highest profitability among our customer segments, highlighting its significance to our business.

3. **Market Insights:** The state of "California" emerges as the largest and most profitable market within the consumer segment, while "North Dakota" represents the least profitable market. These insights provide valuable guidance for targeting and optimizing our marketing efforts.

### Model Building

‚Ä¢	Built **Collaborative Recommendation Systems** using **Python NLP Model** to suggest the right items based on user interests.

Based on the observations made, the following recommendations can be proposed:

1. **Capitalize on Growth Opportunities**: With the anticipated growth in Quarterly Sales Forecasting for 2018 Q4, it is advisable to allocate additional resources and marketing efforts during this period to maximize sales potential.

2. **Focus on the "Consumer" Category:** As the most profitable customer segment, it is crucial to prioritize and cater to the needs of consumers. Develop targeted marketing campaigns, personalized promotions, and enhanced customer experiences to further boost profitability within this segment.

3. **Optimize Market Strategies:** Given the significance of the "California" market and its profitability, allocate resources and marketing initiatives to maintain and expand market share in this region. Conversely, explore strategies to improve performance in the "North Dakota" market, such as conducting market research, identifying customer needs, and tailoring marketing approaches accordingly.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the implementation of a SQL-based Superstore Data Warehouse and the analysis of customer records have provided valuable insights for business growth. Through the Quarterly Sales Forecasting Dashboard and the Popularity and Collaborative Recommendation Systems, businesses can make data-driven decisions, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive profitability.
